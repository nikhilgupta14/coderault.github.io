<div class="f">
	Proper design has become a critical element needed to engage website  users.However , little research has been conducted to define the specific elements needed in effective website design. We attempt to review and consolidate research on effective design and to define a short list of elements frequently used in research. The design elements mentioned most frequently in the reviewed literature were navigation , graphical representation, organization, content utility , purpose, simplicity , and readability . We discuss how previous studies define and evaluate these seven elements. This review and the resulting short list of  design elements may be used to help designers and researchers to operationalize best practices for facilitating and predicting user engagement.

<p class="dp"><u> UNIQUE IDEATION</u> 
	<br><br>
	
	Design is the first step in the development phase for any techniques and principles for the purpose of defining a device, a process or system in sufficient detail to permit its physical realization.
<br>
Once the software requirements have been analysed and specified the software design involves three technical activities - design, coding, implementation and testing that are required to build and verify the software.
<br>
The design activities are of main importance in this phase, because in this activity, decisions ultimately affecting the success of the software implementation and its ease of maintenance are made.
<br> These decisions have the final bearing upon reliability and maintainability of the system. Design is the only way to accurately translate the customer’s requirements into finished software or a system
